# Fix Opera Linux libffmpeg & WidevineCdm

* Fixes Opera html5 media content including DRM-protected one.
* This script must be executed all times opera fails on showing html5 media content.
* On Debian-based, RedHat-based and Arch-based distributions it could be started automatically after Opera each update or reinstall.
* Works only with native versions of Opera. Won't work with flatpak/snap releses.
* May not work with opera-beta and opera-develper.

## Requirements

1. **curl** (is needed for downloading the ffmpeg lib and widevine)

   **unzip** (is needed for unpacking the downloaded file)

   **git** (is needed for fetching this script)

   **jq** (is needed for parsing JSON from github)

2. (*Optional*) **python3-dnf-plugin-post-transaction-actions** (is needed for autoupdate in RedHat-based systems)

    The main installer - `install.sh` - auto-detects your distro and installs the both the appropriate and the optional requirements by itself, if they're missing.
